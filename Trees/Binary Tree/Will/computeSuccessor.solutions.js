The successor of a node in a binary tree is the node that appears immediately after the given node in an in order traversal.

Design an algorithm that compuates the successor of a node in a binary tree.

if the !root return null;
do an in order traversal from the root node to find the passed in node;

if the node found then check if theres a node.right, if there is then return that node;
