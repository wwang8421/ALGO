/*  Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \    / \
7    2  5   1
Return:

[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]*/

/* 
PSEUDO:
have a results arr;
have a curr arr and push into nodes into arr;
if its a leaf node and curr.val === s then push curr arr to the result;
when you are done traversing then return the result;
*/
